# Security Guidelines

## Environment Variables
- Copy .env.example to .env and fill in your actual values
- NEVER commit .env files to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration

## Secrets Management
- Store API keys, passwords, and tokens in environment variables
- Use secure secret management services in production
- Regularly rotate credentials and keys

## Git Security
- This repository is configured with .gitignore to exclude sensitive files
- Review all commits before pushing to ensure no secrets are included
- Use pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets

## Best Practices
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Use strong, unique passwords for each service
- Enable two-factor authentication where possible
- Regularly update dependencies and security patches
